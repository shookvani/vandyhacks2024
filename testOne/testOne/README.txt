This contains the code that integrates the battleship program and mongodb with the spring boot framework and tomcat servlet service to host a local web app. 
It is not fully functional as there is a clash between the versions of the mongodb and the drivers used by the spring boot framework.

Instructions: Please use Java 17 for this program.
This includes a work-in-progress web app for the battleship game, using the spring boot framework and tomcat servlet.
As of 9/29, when accessing the web app via local host the local host will not load but the terminal does update with
a new iteration of a game. The terminal shows no outstanding errors, and that tomcat server had been successfully
initialized and started.
