Instructions: Please refer to the README.txt files within both project folders to better understand what they do!

Thee two project folders are meant to be integrated together, however we have yet to find a solution to get the webpage to display.
The Battleship folder contains the main Java program to run our game.
The testOne folder contains the Spring Boot, Tomcat, and other tech in our attempt to make a working web page too integrate our game.
